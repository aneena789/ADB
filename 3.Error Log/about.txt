The command adb logcat *:E is used to display only error-level logs from all system and app components on an Android device. It filters the log output to show critical issues such as crashes, unhandled exceptions, or serious system errors, making it easier for developers or testers to identify and debug problems without being overwhelmed by less severe log messages like debug or info logs.
