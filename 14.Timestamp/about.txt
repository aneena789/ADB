This Windows batch script:

Extracts the current date and time

Formats them into a timestamp like 20250725_2250

Runs adb logcat -d to dump the current logs

Saves the logs to a file named like:
logcat_20250725_2250.txt

This is useful for collecting logs during app testing, crash reports, or debugging â€” each time-stamped for easy tracking.
