To monitor real-time logs for a specific app, you use adb logcat with a filter based on the appâ€™s package name or process ID (PID).
adb logcat | findstr com.example.app
Replace com.example.app with your app's actual package name (e.g., com.whatsapp).
This filters the live log output to only show lines containing the app's package name. It's quick but may include unrelated logs that mention the package name as plain text.
