Yes, the Android version can impact Bluetooth connection time because each Android release includes improvements to the Bluetooth stack, device discovery, and connection handling. Newer versions, such as Android 10 through 13, typically offer faster and more reliable Bluetooth connections due to optimizations in profile negotiation (like A2DP and HFP), reduced connection latency, and better background process management. Additionally, newer Android versions are more likely to support the latest Bluetooth specifications (e.g., 5.0, 5.1, 5.3), which further enhance connection speed and stability. However, the effect also depends on the device's hardware, firmware, and the Bluetooth version of the connecting device.
